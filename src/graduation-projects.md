Graduation projects
---

The graduation projects are real-life projects built for a community organisation.

You can play this game that the students built as part of it. (https://legodi-app.herokuapp.com/#/weegie/)

The projects are database-driven apps built with Node, Mongo and React. This can give an idea of where we want to get our students at the end of the six months. By the end of the course, our graduates are comfortable using these frameworks to build full-stack web applications.
