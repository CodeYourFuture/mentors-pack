Course structure
---

The course consists of modules/sprints that are three weeks each. We start with three core JS modules, then Node and React, and a graduation project.

The format consists of one main face to face class every Saturday plus (a lot of) homework to be completed during the week and group projects.

Mid-week face to face meetings and online sessions are also regularly organised between mentors and students to help with homework. This is done on an ad-hoc basis and on days, times and venues arranged between those taking part in the arrangement.

At the end of each module, we run a retrospective and take actions based on the students' feedback.
