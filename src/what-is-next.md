What is next
---

We take new mentors at the start of a module. The next module is JS-Core 2 and starts on Saturday 24 April, 2018.

We'd like you to come over the Saturday before (17th April) even if it's for only few hours. This will give you an idea of how the class, the students and the mentors work.

If you're interested in getting involved:

- Please confirm you have read and agreed to the Code of Conduct.
- Tell us which roles you'd be more comfortable to start with.
- Let us know how much time you think you can dedicate per week.
- Please let us know whether you'll be coming on Saturday 17th April.
