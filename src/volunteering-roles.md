Volunteering roles
---

Volunteers primarily act as mentors to help students who get stuck with problems during Saturday’s lessons. The average class size is around 16, and normally between 5-10 mentors attend Saturday’s classes. However, there are a lot of different ways to be involved in with CodeYourFuture that do not require attendance at teaching sessions.

Although the syllabus is JavaScript heavy, non-JS developers are welcome to join. In the first few months, the focus is on logical thinking, data structures and programming constructs. So, even if you are not a JS developer, you can still take an active part.

Later in the course, the students learn frameworks such as NodeJS, Express, React and MongoDB. Non-JS mentors have said that they found these modules helpful for their own learning.

Depending on their preference and how much time they have available, mentors can volunteer to one or several of the roles or tasks below:

## Module Lead
The module leaders lead the preparation of a module's lessons and exercises and are responsible for delivering its content. 			

The module leaders are normally from within the group of mentors who have been around from the previous cohort and have a good feeling about how to run a class. 		

They don't necessarily teach the full Saturday class though, as they're normally supported by other mentors who wish to teach part of it.

## Saturday Class Teacher
If you wish to support the lead mentor on a particular part of the module syllabus by teaching a section of the course, then please talk to him/her and they can get you organised to teach in class.

## In-class Assistance
This is where most new mentors start as it is a good way to get to know the students and the other mentors.

What does the role involve? During the class, new concepts and exercises are introduced by the lead mentors. The students are then expected to practice these with hands-on exercises. The in-class assistants help students if they get stuck or they need some clarification.

Mentors are not expected to come every weekend, although advanced absence notification is appreciated to help the team plan.

## Mid-week help
Some mentors can't commit their Saturdays but they are able to meet students midweek to help with homework, provide group project support, or help them get a better understanding of the concepts they're learning. This is evolving into a parallel stream of work that is just as valued and important as the main Saturday class.

Normally, volunteer mentors offer help on a certain day of the week (few hours 	after work for example) and students respond if they can join. 	

These can also be requested by the students by asking whether there are any mentors available to help on a  specific date.

All communication is done via the cohort's Slack channel.

## Student-Mentor pairing
		This is a new role we are trialing at the moment.

It consists on pairing one student with one mentor for a few weeks. 		

The mentor becomes the student's first point of contact and is responsible of reviewing their homework (or delegating the review to other mentors) and escalating if they feel the student need extra help.

## General online help
Sometimes students ask for clarifications or questions related to particular homework exercises on the Slack channel. Any mentor can reply on the same platform and thus provide a benefit to the rest of the students.

## Homework review
The homework is done as Pull Requests on the students' Github accounts. CodeYourFuture volunteers review and provide feedback that the students should act on.

## Graduation project
The graduation projects, at the end of the course, require developers who are comfortable jumping into several different roles: being the architect of the project, lead developer taking responsibility of PRs and their quality, a lot of Project Management and wearing the hat of Scrum master a few times.

If you'd like to get	involved in one or few of those roles, please let one of the lead mentors know.

Please note that roles are normally assigned per module, not for the duration of the whole course.

These are the main roles at the moment, but we are a growing community that is shaped by its members, both students and mentors, so the roles also grow organically. For example, for the current cohort, we are trialing one-to-one online mentorship as the size of the group means it is harder for the lead mentor to keep track of individual student progress.
