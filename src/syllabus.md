Syllabus
---

Our core syllabus is JavaScript heavy and we consider it to be on an ongoing improvement process. The syllabus is open source, and we constantly listen to our mentors and students and adapt the course.

We have also introduced extra modules as and when the opportunity has arisen or the community has felt the need to do so. Examples of this are the Java module, the Agile module and the WordPress module, etc. We also take students through mock interviews and help them prepare their CVs.
