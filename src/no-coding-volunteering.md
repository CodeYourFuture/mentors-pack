# Volunteering (no coding)
The coordination and management of the class is as important as teaching the main class itself. There are several tasks in that aspect, such as:

- Manage our email inbox
- Help manage the new student application process
- Identify and contact potential employers for the graduates
- Identify funding opportunities
- Class and mentors' coordination (chasing up things being done)
- Other general management tasks

We expect people to come to the class for few weeks before getting involved with this side of things, but if you are interested in helping out then please let us know.
