# Volunteering (no coding)
The coordination and management of the class is as important as teaching the main class itself. There are several tasks in that aspect, such as:


- **Email duty**: This is by far the most time-consuming admin task, we need people to respond to emails and enquiries reaching the generic london@codeyourfuture.io. 

- **Students recruitment and following on the Application Process**: Recruitment of students for next classes and following on the new applicants and their progress in the application process, as well as coordinating with other cities to improve the process and streamline it.

- **Class coordination**: coordination the students' homework, attendance and monitoring their progress. A lot of chasing for both mentors and students.

- **Companies outreach**: Reaching out to companies to establish relationships, primarily to find job opportunities for graduates.

These four area above are the most time consuming, then there are other areas such as:

- **Fundraising**: Exploring fundraising possibilities to cover childcare, transport, mobile internet and other costs of students.
- **Media**: Media outreach, interviews etc..
- **Intra-city outreach**: Reaching out to CYF London and Manchester, to share knowledge and expertise.
- **Tools & Systems**: Custom tools we build to facilitate our work
- **Social**: Social activities for the students and mentors
- **Community partnerships**: partnerships with community organisations and NGOs in London and beyond
- **Childcare**: arranging childcare (seasonal - just before the start of new modules)
- **Mentors recruitment**: Finding new mentors and volunteers to join us, and helping them onboard easily

We expect people to come to the class few times before getting involved with this side of things, but if you are interested in helping out then please let us know as soon as possible.

## Systems
Some of the systems we use: **PipeDrive** for mentors and students' applications, **Slack integration** and **Google groups** to access emails and **Trello** where we have a board to manage the admin and management tasks, and assigning them to other mentors and members of the team.
