How each class is structured
---

The weekly Saturday class is normally held at Kinning Park Complex from 11am to 5:30pm, including a 1 hour lunch break. Food is brought by those mentors and students who wish to do so and shared amongst everyone - there is no requirement to bring food, but itâ€™s a nice way to contribute.

The format of the classes can differ depending on the module and its lead mentor.

In the initial JS-Core modules, there tends to be a set of exercises that the students can get through on their own pace. The class is interrupted every now and then is then brought back together to explain a new concept to the group.

Later modules use a format closer to that of a workshop where everyone are expected to follow at the same pace.
