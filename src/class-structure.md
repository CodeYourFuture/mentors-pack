How each class is structured
---

The weekly Saturday class is normally held at _[include address with Google Maps reference]_ from 11am to 5:30pm, including a 1 hour lunch break. Food is brought by those mentors and students who wish to do so and shared amongst everyone - there is no requirement to bring food, but itâ€™s a nice way to contribute.

The format of the classes can differ depending on the module and its lead mentor.

In the initial JS-Core modules, there tends to be a set of exercises that the students can go through at their own pace. Every now and then the class is interrupted for students to do the exercises and is then brought back together to explain a new concept to the group.

Later modules use a format closer to that of a workshop where everyone is expected to follow at the same pace.
