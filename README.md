CodeYourFuture is a programming school for refugees and asylum seekers in the UK.

We offer a free six-months intensive program teaching Web Applications development with the aim of preparing the students for a job as a Junior developer by the end of the course.

We have been running in London since October 2016, and we now have classes in Glasgow and Manchester. Our second cohort in Glasgow started on the 20th of January 2018.
