CodeYourFuture is a programming school for refugees and asylum seekers in the UK.

We offer a free six-months intensive program teaching Web Applications development with the aim of preparing the students for a job as a Junior developer by the end of the course.

We have been running in London since October 2016, and we now have classes in Glasgow and Manchester.
